## Introduction

**cub3D** is a project developed as part of our curriculum at 42 school. Itâ€™s a mini 3D game using the raycasting technique, built with the MiniLibX graphics library. This project uses an enhanced version of MiniLibX called [MiniLibX-Extended](https://github.com/leofarhi/MiniLibX-Extended), which provides additional features.

## Features and Goal

**cub3D** is a 3D reinterpretation of the classic *Pac-Man*. Main features include:

* **Main goal**: Collect all the yellow balls to win.
* **Ghosts**: Avoid them, or eat them after grabbing a green ball.
* **Minimap**: 2D view of the map, similar to the original *Pac-Man*.
* **Doors**: Open them with a left click or the Space key.
* **Pause**: Press Tab to pause the game.

## Installation and Compilation

To try **cub3D**, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository along with the original MiniLibX version.
2. Compile the project by running:

   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. Launch the game with:

   ```bash
   ./cub3D maps/valid/[your_map].cub
   ```

   > For the best experience, try the default map:
   >
   > ```bash
   > ./cub3D maps/valid/pacman.cub
   > ```

## Map Generation

**cub3D** lets you create your own custom maps with an integrated generator.

### Steps:

1. Run the map generator script:

   ```bash
   python ./map_gen.py
   ```
2. Once your map is generated (as `gen_map.cub`), run it with:

   ```bash
   ./cub3D maps/gen_map.cub
   ```
